# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this project as a way to familiarize myself with the various programming languages of full stack development. It has helped me take the lessons I've been taught from a conceptual place into skills that I can actually apply to something concrete. I intend to add upon it going forward to continue gaining the muscle memory of iteration.
